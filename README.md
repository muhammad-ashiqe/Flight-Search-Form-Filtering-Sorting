Here's a clean and professional `README.md` **setup instructions section only**, formatted perfectly for your GitHub repo:

````markdown
## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

---

### üìÅ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammad-ashiqe/Flight-Search-Form-Filtering-Sorting.git
cd Flight-Search-Form-Filtering-Sorting
````

---

### üîß 2. Backend Setup (Express + MongoDB)

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` folder with the following content:

```env
PORT=7000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string if not use mine mongodb+srv://muhammadashiqe007:vFUIGcv3fYgJABSW@cluster0.i28huti.mongodb.net/flightData?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

#### Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### üíª 3. Frontend Setup (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> The app will be running at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Final Check

* Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
* Backend: `http://localhost:7000/api/flight/all`

Make sure both are running correctly and your MongoDB connection is active.

```

You can paste this directly into your `README.md` under a `## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions` section or as a standalone file if that's all you need.

Let me know if you'd like me to generate deployment instructions (e.g., using Vercel + Render) next!
